# Rust Web Development (Warp)

I am learning web development with Rust, and I'm using the book [Rust Web
Development](https://www.manning.com/books/rust-web-development) as my guide.

This project follows the examples in the book and utilizes the
[warp](https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp) web framework. I also maintain a
separate repository for this project, where I've implemented the same
functionality using the [axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) framework, to
ensure a deeper understanding and avoid mere copy-pasting from the book.
